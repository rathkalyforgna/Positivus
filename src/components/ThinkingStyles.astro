    Based on the tests, my creative type is "The Dreamer," which emphasizes
    harnessing the power of imagination. This suggests that I excel at
    envisioning possibilities and exploring new ideas, leveraging creativity to
    drive innovation. In my daily life, this strength helps me generate original
    concepts and think outside the box, although it may sometimes hinder me from
    focusing on practical implementation.

    <br />
    My thinking style is predominantly an "Original Thinker" (100%), which indicates
    that I thrive on generating unique and innovative ideas. This thinking style
    supports my ability to approach problems with fresh perspectives. However, it
    might also challenge me in tasks that require more structured or detailed planning,
    as my strengths lie more in ideation than execution.
    <br />
    <br />
    To further develop my thinking style, I plan to balance my imaginative strengths
    with practical skills. This could involve setting aside time for focused planning
    and project management to complement my creativity. Understanding my "Dreamer"
    type and dominant thinking style helps me recognize areas where I can innovate
    while also identifying where I may need additional support or structure.
