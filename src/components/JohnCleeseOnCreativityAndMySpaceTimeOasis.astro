    <div class="mb-4">The main takeaways in the article from John Cleese:</div>
    <ol class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <li>
        <strong>1. The Importance of Space and Time:</strong>T Cleese highlights
        that creativity requires both physical and mental space. This means
        having a dedicated time and place where you can work without
        interruptions. Such a space allows for deep focus and free thinking,
        essential for creative work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2. The Role of Playfulness:</strong> He emphasizes that creativity
        thrives in an environment that encourages playfulness and experimentation.
        When individuals feel free to explore ideas without fear of judgment, they
        are more likely to come up with innovative solutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3. The Need for Structured Unstructured Time:</strong> Cleese suggests
        that while having dedicated time for creativity is crucial, this time should
        be somewhat unstructured to allow for spontaneous thinking and exploration.
        Rigid schedules can stifle creativity, whereas flexible time allows for the
        natural flow of ideas.

      My Ideal Personal Space-Time Oasis at Home: would be a quiet, comfortable
      chair, a small volume from relaxing lofi music playing in the background
      that set time to work and take a break, that allow me to focus on my
      creative work, and free from distractions.

      <li>
        <strong>Distractions:</strong> Interruptions from family members, receiving
        notifications on your phone, or other distractions can disrupt my creative
        flow.

      <li>
        <strong>Lack of Structure:</strong> Without making it a routine, it can be

      <ol>
        <strong>1. Create a Dedicated Space:</strong> Designate a specific area for
        creative work, separate from regular workspaces to mentally signal that itâ€™s
        time for innovation.
      </ol>
      <li>

        <strong>3. Promote a Relaxed Atmosphere:</strong> Foster a culture that values

      <li>
        <strong>4. Minimize Distractions:</strong> Ensure that the space is equipped
        with the necessary tools and minimizes interruptions from other tasks or
